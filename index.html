									<!-- <p><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">I am recruiting Ph.D. students. Please contact me if you are interested in research on computer architecture.</span> </p> -->

									<p>I am an assistant professor in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea University. I lead <a href="https://comsys-lab.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Architecture and System Software Lab (ComSys)</a>. My research interests focus on designing next-generation computing systems, including hardware and software architectures for energy-efficient datacenters, processor architectures (CPUs, GPUs, and neural network accelerators), in-storage processing, memory system, and high-performance computing.</p>

									<p>Prior to joining Korea University, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at SungKyunKwan University (SKKU). From March 2019 to Feburary 2021, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://parsa.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">PARSA</a> at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> (PI: Professor Babak Falsafi). I completed Ph.D. in the <a href="http://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/ee_en/index.do" target="_blank">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/" target="_blank">Yonsei University</a> (Advisor: Professor Won Woo Ro). From August 2016 to August 2017, I worked as a visiting graduate scholar at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">the University of Southern California</a> (Faculty Sponsor: Professor Murali Annavaram). From 2011 to 2014, I worked as a software engineer at Mobile Communications Buniness, Samsung Electronics. </p>
